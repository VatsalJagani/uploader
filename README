UPLOADER!

This is a simple app that allows users to reliably upload large files via a web browser.

After installing, simply set the necessary configuration in app.conf and you're ready to go.

There is no restriction on file type or contents during upload. Please consult your Splunk administrator regarding relevant security consideration.
